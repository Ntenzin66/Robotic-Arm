# Prototype designs

We originally settled on using carbon fiber for the rods on the arm, however it was much more expensive and ended up not being worth it because of the strength and price of the acrylic already in the lab.

# Servo Holder

## Description

This part will be used as a case that fits over the servo to hold it and all its wiring in place while the arm is in use.

## Criteria & Constraints



## Bill of Materials

    •Screws for securing the holder
    •Metal gear servos

## Documentation/Design
The first part we started to design was the servo holder. An immediate issue we faced is how we were going to insert the model of the servo into the actual design (this would be used for scaling.) We eventually achieved this by navigating to the shared parts and inserting the servo into the design. To get the correct dimensions we utilized the Use tool (The definition of the Use tool as stated on onshape is "Project edges or faces of an existing part or sketch onto the active sketch plane.) The next issue was how we were going to get the servo into the physical part. We decided on having the servo slide upwards into the part by removing slots where other components like wiring might get in the way.

# Hook/Rod

## Description

Rod attached to the servo horn that is used to hold the grocery bags

## Criteria & Constraints


## Bill of Materials

    •Servo holder that was designed previously
    •Properly fitted horn for the servo
    •Screws to secure the hook to the servo

## Documentation/Design

The rod and hook took a little time to get a good model of, but in the end we ended up being happy with the design. We started the hook with rectangular sketch on the servo double horn, then extruded it so it was a rectangular box. In the middle of the box, we sketched a circle and extruded that out 160mm. At the end of the circle extrude we sketched the hook and morphed it into what we thought was the best design. After this, we sketched circles on the rectangular box for the screw holes. We made the dimensions of the circles the same as the holes on the horn in order to get even screw holes. Though we did have trouble sketching the circles, we got around it by using the hook's rectangular box as the sketch face and not the servo horn. If we used the servo horn as the sketch face, the extrude would not work and ended up causing more problems. The second picture listed above is what the hook looks like when it is attached to the servo. The design is what we think is the best fit for us.

## Code
```python
import time
import board
import pwmio
import servo

# create a PWMOut object on Pin A2.
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A2, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)

# Create a servo object, my_servo.
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

while True:
    for angle in range(0, 180, 5):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)
    for angle in range(180, 0, -5):  # 180 - 0 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)

```
## Information / Process

On the last day of the quarter January 28 2022 we ran into a major problem of not having a proper proof of concept. We immediately rushed to put something together which consisted of a makeshift acrylic hook and old servo code. However the code we had used on the old servo project had become outdated and we had to find and download the newer correct libraries to get it to run again. When the code finally began to work the was another issue that was presented, there was not enough power going to the servo and we had to use a modified 6V battery pack to get it to run the way we had hoped. The next step was to see how much weight it could which was all but succesful. Initially we tested the strength of the hook with a bag and a 5.6 pound aluminum block. This caused the servo to stall out and we came to the conclusion that with the current design it could only hold up to about 3 pounds
